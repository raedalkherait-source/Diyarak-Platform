# Listing Subject Reference Requirements

This document records the confirmed requirements, implemented decisions, and remaining unresolved behavior for identifying and validating the subject published by a Listing.

ADR-0010 through ADR-0012 define the subject-reference contract and its ownership. ADR-0016 through ADR-0019 define the initial subject-availability rule, its application-layer orchestration, and the port used to perform the check.

## Confirmed requirements

- A Listing is separate from the persistent asset that it publishes.
- Creating another Listing for an existing Property must not require creating a duplicate Property asset.
- A Listing therefore needs a way to identify its published subject.
- The subject-reference contract must remain sector-agnostic.
- `Diyarak.Platform.Listing` must not depend on a business module such as `Diyarak.Market.Property`.
- `Diyarak.Market.Listing` must not depend directly on another business module implementation such as `Diyarak.Market.Property`.
- A Module-to-Core dependency requires explicit approval through an accepted architecture decision.
- The initial Market use case is publishing a Property Listing while preserving a design that can support additional subject types later.
- Publishing a Listing requires its referenced subject to exist and be available for publication.
- Until a Property lifecycle is defined, an existing Property is considered available for Listing publication.
- Subject-availability validation occurs in application-level orchestration before the Listing aggregate is asked to publish itself.

## Implemented contract

ADR-0010 defines `ListingSubjectReference` in `Diyarak.Platform.Listing`.

The reference contains:

- a `Guid` subject identifier;
- a non-empty opaque string subject type.

Platform Listing does not define a business-sector enum for subject types.

Business modules own the meaning of their subject-type values.

`Diyarak.Market.Listing` defines the confirmed Property subject type as `market.property` and is explicitly approved to reference `Diyarak.Platform.Listing` for this contract.

ADR-0011 requires a Listing to keep the same `ListingSubjectReference` for its lifetime. Publishing a different subject requires creating a new Listing.

ADR-0012 requires the consuming business module to validate which subject types it supports. `Diyarak.Market.Listing` currently accepts only `market.property` and rejects unsupported subject types. This validation remains separate from verifying that the referenced Property exists.

ADR-0016 places subject-availability validation in application-level publication orchestration before `Listing.Publish()` is called.

ADR-0017 defines Property availability as existence until a Property lifecycle introduces additional availability states.

ADR-0018 introduces the Application layer for cross-module use-case orchestration while preserving Module isolation.

ADR-0019 defines the Application-owned `IPropertyExistenceChecker` port. `Diyarak.Market.Application` uses this port without referencing `Diyarak.Market.Property` directly.

`PublishListingUseCase` implements the initial workflow: it rejects publication when the referenced Property does not exist and calls the Listing aggregate's `Publish()` behavior when the Property exists.

## Remaining open requirements

The following behavior remains undefined and must not be invented:

- The concrete persistence-backed implementation of `IPropertyExistenceChecker`.
- Property and Listing persistence representations beyond the domain contracts.
- Listing loading, saving, and transaction boundaries for the publication workflow.
- Transport representation and API behavior.
- What happens to a Listing when its referenced subject is removed, archived, or otherwise becomes unavailable after publication.
- Subject resolution beyond the current Property-existence check.
- Any additional lifecycle behavior associated with subject availability.
- Approval of any additional Module-to-Core dependency or additional Market subject type.

These questions must be resolved from concrete product and architecture requirements rather than inferred from the current Market implementation.
